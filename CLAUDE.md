# OpenRing: project context for Claude

OpenRing is an open-source, self-hosted alternative to paid voice AI agent platforms. People run it on
their own machine or server with their own provider keys, so there is **no per-minute platform fee**.
Its API is **Vapi-compatible**: existing clients migrate by changing the base URL. Code, commits and
docs are in English. See CONTRIBUTING.md for setup and rules.

## Architecture

- `openring/api.py` FastAPI app: Vapi-style REST (`/assistant`, `/phone-number`, `/call`), Twilio
  voice webhook (`POST /twilio/voice`, validates `X-Twilio-Signature`, refuses calls while
  `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset unless `VALIDATE_TWILIO_SIGNATURE=false`), media websocket
  (`/ws/twilio` and `/ws/telnyx`: one connection per call, it atomically claims the queued call via `Store.claim`;
  the assistant comes from the call record, never from stream parameters), `POST /call/web`
  (browser test call: answers the dashboard's WebRTC offer with Pipecat's `SmallWebRTCConnection`
  and runs the call as a background task; non-trickle ICE), `POST /call` (outbound, Vapi body:
  creates a queued `outboundPhoneCall`, Twilio REST places it with
  `Url=$PUBLIC_URL/twilio/voice?callId=...`; signatures cover the query string; `POST /twilio/status`
  ends calls that never connected with Vapi's endedReason), dashboard at `/`, `/health`,
  `GET /stats` (overview numbers, `openring/stats.py`).
- Dashboard login (`openring/auth.py`, like OmniRoute): one password per server, scrypt hash in the DB
  `settings` table; sessions in the `sessions` table as `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict` cookies. Requests
  authorize with the Bearer API key OR session cookie + `X-OpenRing: dashboard` header (CSRF guard).
  `/auth/state|setup|login|logout|password`; the first password is chosen only from direct localhost
  or set by `OPENRING_PASSWORD`; `openring --reset-password` clears it. `/dashboard/info` (session only)
  gives the Settings/Providers pages the API key, URLs and which provider keys are set (never the keys).
  `GET /providers/{id}/balance` (session) reads what's left on accounts that report it (`keys.BALANCES`).
- `openring/bot.py` one live call: `run_call(transport, sample_rate=...)` runs Pipecat's pipeline
  transport -> STT -> LLM -> TTS; `twilio_transport` (8 kHz) and `web_transport` (WebRTC) build the
  transport. First message, end-call phrases, saves transcript and per-turn latency
  (`artifact.performanceMetrics`, Vapi's shape, in ms, from Pipecat's `UserBotLatencyObserver`),
  records usage in Vapi's `costBreakdown` fields (`llmPromptTokens`, `llmCompletionTokens`, `ttsCharacters`,
  plus `transcriberAudioSeconds`) and `performanceMetrics.firstWordLatency`, sends Vapi-style
  `end-of-call-report` to `server.url`. Services are built in a worker thread.
- `openring/providers.py` maps the Vapi assistant JSON to a stack using Vapi's provider names (`ALIASES`
  for other spellings). LLM: OpenAI-compatible APIs (`LLM_PROVIDERS`: openai, anthropic, google, groq,
  openrouter, deepseek, xai, cerebras, together-ai, deepinfra, perplexity-ai, mistral, fireworks, ollama,
  omniroute) + `custom-llm` with `model.url`; `supports_developer_role` only for openai (a provider's 400 ends the call),
  and Pipecat's own services for mistral, deepseek, perplexity-ai. STT (`STT_SERVICES`): deepgram, assembly-ai, gladia, soniox,
  cartesia, 11labs, and whisper (local, `openring/whisper.py`). TTS (`TTS_SERVICES`): 11labs, kokoro (free, local, default), cartesia, deepgram (Vapi
  short voice names -> `aura-2-<name>-en`), openai, rime-ai, neuphonic, smallest-ai, inworld. Defaults
  (nova-3, af_heart) apply only to their own provider. Kokoro uses the
  int8 model (~120 MB with voices) in `~/.cache/pipecat/kokoro-onnx`: `warm_up()` at startup
  downloads it if missing (atomic `.part` rename) and loads it once; Pipecat's per-service model
  load is patched to share that instance. Calls refuse Kokoro with a progress message until ready.
- `openring/whisper.py` (`whisper` extra, faster-whisper): `prepare(model)` downloads and loads a model in a
  background thread (from the app lifespan and on assistant save, via `providers.prepare_local`); calls
  refuse with a progress message until it is loaded; Pipecat's `WhisperModel` is patched to the shared,
  greedy-decoding instance; `LocalWhisper` upsamples phone audio to 16 kHz (Pipecat doesn't). CUDA when
  available, else CPU int8. `GET /providers/ollama/models` lists Ollama's pulled models.
- Words to recognize (`providers.stt_words`): Vapi's `transcriber.keyterm`, `keytermsPrompt`, `keywords` go to the field
  each transcriber and model take (`StackPlan.stt_words`). Real Deepgram answers HTTP 400 to nova-3 with `keywords` and
  to nova-2 with `keyterm`, so they are never sent that way; a transcriber that can't use them gets a plan warning.
- `"language": "multi"` appends `FOLLOW_LANGUAGE` (answer in the caller's language) to the system messages;
  a voice outside `MULTILINGUAL_VOICES` (11labs, openai) adds a plan warning.
- Fallbacks (`openring/fallback.py`): Vapi's `transcriber.fallbackPlan.transcribers`, `model.fallbackModels`
  (names, or `{provider, model}` for another provider) and `voice.fallbackPlan.voices` resolve into
  `StackPlan.fallbacks`; `build_services` wraps a layer in Pipecat's `ServiceSwitcher`/`LLMSwitcher` with
  the `Failover` strategy (switches on auth, quota, rate-limit, server and connectivity errors, never back).
  A model switch queues an `LLMRunFrame` so the new model answers; switches land in `providerFallbacks`
  with a `reason`. Pipecat's switcher gates what goes into an inactive service, not what comes out, so
  `fallback.model_watch` (after the LLM) stops the replaced model (`_start_interruption`, Pipecat's own way),
  closes its open response and drops its leftovers; with `maxLatencyMs` it switches a model that hasn't
  started answering in time (`Failover.skip`).
- Model routes (`openring/routes.py` + `/model-route`, collection `routes`): models in order + `maxLatencyMs`
  + `cooldownMinutes`. `model.routeId` on an assistant; `routes.expand` (via `api._plan`, used wherever a plan
  is resolved) puts the first non-resting model in `model` and the rest in `fallbackModels`. A model the call
  moved off rests in memory (`routes.let_down`), so new calls start on the next one. `preset`
  (fastest/cheapest/reliable, `routes.PRESETS`) sets `order` + `maxLatencyMs` + `cooldownMinutes`; `custom` keeps
  its own; a PATCH touching one of them makes the route custom. "fastest" orders by the median time to first
  answer token (`routes._speed`, last 20 per model, from Pipecat's `TTFATMetricsData` on calls and from
  `routes.probe` via `POST /model-route/{id}/measure`; saved in the settings table as `model_speed`). A route with
  `kind` `transcriber`/`voice` (dashboard: `#routes/new-transcriber|new-voice`, `kindOf`, `layerSaved`) is used by `transcriber.routeId`/`voice.routeId`:
  `routes._expand_layer` puts its first member in the layer and the rest in `fallbackPlan`; members rest under
  `(kind, provider, model|voiceId)` (`StackPlan.stt_ident`/`tts_ident`, `service.openring_member`), `rest_after_switch`
  is called by `bot` on any layer's switch; order `listed`/`cheapest` only, no latency limit.
- `openring/prices.py`: list prices. Models from `llm_prices.json` (regenerate with `scripts/update_prices.py`:
  LiteLLM + OpenRouter), STT per minute and TTS per 1M characters hand-kept in `STT`/`TTS`, user overrides in
  `~/.openring/prices.json`; unknown is None, never guessed. `bot.Usage` keeps usage per Pipecat processor and
  prices it per service (`service.openring_price`, set by `providers._labeled`) into `cost` and
  `costBreakdown.{llm,stt,tts,total,unpriced}`; `GET /prices`; "cheapest" routes rank by `prices.blended`.
- Groq's catalog changed in 2026: Llama 3.x is gone; use `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (fast) or
  `openai/gpt-oss-120b`. Groq's Cloudflare returns 403 to Python's default urllib User-Agent.
- Genesys Cloud (`openring/genesys.py` + `/ws/genesys`, beta): Audio Connector over AudioHook. Refused unless
  `X-API-KEY` = `GENESYS_API_KEY` and the HTTP message signature (HMAC-SHA256, key = base64-decoded
  `GENESYS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `@authority` from PUBLIC_URL, required components and 30 s max age as in Genesys's
  reference server) verifies. The `open` message is read before the pipeline, fed to Pipecat's
  `GenesysAudioHookSerializer` (it answers `opened`, pings, `close`), and picks the assistant: input variable
  `assistantId`, else the dnis number (`answer_inbound`). Other input variables become `variableValues`.
  Output variables: `action` finished/transfer, `transferTo`, `callId`; a transfer sends `disconnect`.
- `openring/campaigns.py` + `/campaign` (Vapi's shape; the list is `{results, metadata}`): `Dialer` runs one
  asyncio task per live campaign (started on create, resumed from the app lifespan), dials through the same
  `dial()` as `POST /call` with `campaignId`, keeps `calls` (callId -> customer, status, endedReason) and
  Vapi's `callsCounter*`, saves after every dial so a restart never calls anyone twice, `retryPlan` (OpenRing's own: `maxAttempts` up to 5, `delayMinutes` 5-1440) calls again whoever got `customer-did-not-answer`/`customer-busy` (each call entry keeps `index` and `attempt`), and ends calls cut off
  by a restart (`worker-shutdown`). Cancel claims the status atomically (`Store.update` is atomic too).
- Call limits (`bot.CallLimits`, `providers.call_limits`): Vapi's `maxDurationSeconds` (600) and
  `silenceTimeoutSeconds` (30, without activity: the clock waits while someone talks, the model thinks or a tool
  runs) end the call from a watcher task started on connect (`exceeded-max-duration`, `silence-timed-out`, saying
  `endCallMessage`). The watcher keeps another ending's reason, waits for a transfer, and cuts off a call still
  unfinished `END_GRACE_SECONDS` later;
  `messagePlan.idleMessages` use Pipecat's `user_idle_timeout` (`on_user_turn_idle`) on the user aggregator.
- Voicemail (beta, outbound, Twilio only): `twilio.machine_detection` turns `voicemailDetection`/`voicemailMessage`
  into `MachineDetection=DetectMessageEnd` on the Calls API (synchronous: Twilio fetches the voice URL after the
  beep, with `AnsweredBy`). `api.left_on_voicemail` hangs up or `<Play>`s a recording, or sets `answeredBy` on the call
  so `run_phone_call` makes the message the (uninterruptible) greeting with `plan.leave_message`, then ends the call.
- Recordings (`openring/recordings.py`, `artifactPlan.recordingEnabled`, off by default): Pipecat's
  `AudioBufferProcessor` after `transport.output()`, written to `<db dir>/recordings/<call id>.wav` as it comes;
  `GET`/`DELETE /call/{id}/recording` are behind the API key or a session. A disk error loses the recording, not the call.
  Retention: `/settings/recordings` (365 days by default, 0 keeps them, in the settings table); a task from the app
  lifespan cleans every 6 hours, only files named after a known call.
- `openring/overrides.py`: Vapi's `assistantOverrides` (deep merge) and `{{variables}}` (`customer.*`,
  `variableValues`) in `firstMessage` and `model.messages`, applied per call in `media_stream`.
- `openring/tools.py` Vapi tools: `function` (POSTs Vapi's `tool-calls` message to `tool.server.url` or the
  assistant's `server.url`, reads `{"results": [{"toolCallId", "result"|"error"}]}`), `endCall`
  (endedReason `assistant-ended-call`), `transferCall` (waits until the bot stops speaking, keeps Pipecat's
  Twilio serializer from hanging up, then redirects the call with `<Dial>` TwiML; endedReason
  `assistant-forwarded-call`; browser calls can't transfer; runs apart from its handler, which an interruption cancels;
  a failure tells the model or says `request-failed`). `model.tools` + saved `/tool` docs via
  `model.toolIds`; unsupported types are skipped with a warning. `apiRequest` (`tools.call_api`): the model fills in
  `body`, OpenRing sends it through `netguard.client()`; url, headers and `parameters` are server-side, with
  `{{variables}}` (`overrides.call_context`; percent-encoded in the URL, never in its host); only 2xx counts, no retries
  or redirects, answer capped, not cancelled by an interruption; errors never carry the URL. The model sends only the
  fields `body` declares (`_fillable`). `assistant_tools` skips a tool `check_tool` refuses (imports keep them), and
  `without_secrets` strips keys and addresses from what tool servers and webhooks see of a call. Registered with `llm.register_function`
  and `ToolsSchema` on the LLMContext; the transcript keeps `tool_calls` / `tool_call_result` rows.
- `openring/importer.py` + `POST /import {baseUrl, apiKey}`: copies tools, assistants and Twilio numbers from
  any Vapi-compatible API (pages back with `createdAtLt`), drops source-owned fields and secrets, remaps
  `model.toolIds`, marks docs with `importedFrom` so a re-import updates them; reports per-assistant problems
  (unsupported providers/tools) without refusing the import. Dashboard: **Import** on the Assistants page.
- Plivo (`openring/plivo.py`, `/plivo/voice|status|transfer/{token}`, `/ws/plivo`) and Vonage (`openring/vonage.py`,
  `/vonage/voice|event`, `/ws/vonage`, 16 kHz), beta, in and out, never tried on a real call. Plivo's V3 signature follows its SDK
  (`signed_string`); a transfer's Dial XML sits behind a one-time token. Vonage's webhooks carry an HS256 JWT (signature secret),
  its API takes an RS256 one (application's private key, a file); an outgoing call carries its NCCO inline; a call not transferred is
  also hung up by REST. Telnyx transfers with Update call (`Texml=<Dial>` at `/v2/texml/Accounts/{AccountSid of the webhook}/Calls/{CallSid}`; the account is kept in memory until the stream starts). Telnyx calls out through `/v2/texml/calls/{application id}` (`TELNYX_APPLICATION_ID` or the number's
  `texmlApplicationId`). `api.dial` branches on the number's `provider`; endedReason `<provider>-failed-to-connect-call`.
- Knowledge bases (`openring/knowledge.py`, `/file`, `/knowledge-base`, beta): uploads keep only the text, cut into passages,
  in the FTS5 table `file_chunks` (`Store.index_file`, `search_chunks`). PDFs are read by another process
  (`openring/pdf_reader.py`, low priority, `PDF_SECONDS` limit): pypdf is pure Python, and a crafted file takes hours.
  The `query` tool's handler is `knowledge.answer`:
  word search (word starts, bm25) on this server, and when nothing matches and the files are short, all of it, so the model
  reads meanings. `custom-knowledge-base` POSTs Vapi's `knowledge-base-request`; `model.knowledgeBaseId` becomes a query tool.
- Squads (`openring/squads.py`, `/squad`, beta): `squads.cast` is everyone a call can reach (members, `assistantDestinations`,
  whoever a `handoff` names), first is who answers; later members keep unknown `{{variables}}` for what a handoff adds.
  `plan.team` holds their plans. `providers._build_team` makes one switcher per layer whose `Failover` has `groups`, one per
  member (shared STT/TTS when identical, own LLM for its tools); `Failover.enter` switches on a handoff (`entered` tells
  the switch event it's no failure; events run in tasks). `bot.run_call`'s `finish_hand_off` waits for quiet, switches layers, replaces
  the context per `carry_over`, sets tools, keeps the full transcript in `said_before`, records `call.handoffs`.
  A tool that finishes after a handoff answers no model (`CallControls.in_charge`).
- SIP trunks (`openring/sip.py`, `/credential`, beta): SIP over UDP and RTP (G.711) with no dependency. `sip.Server` starts when a
  `byo-sip-trunk` exists (`SIP_HOST`, `SIP_PORT`, `SIP_RTP_PORTS`, `SIP_PUBLIC_IP`). Anything not from a saved gateway is dropped
  silently; `run` (pipeline, cost) starts only on an ACK with our tag. `transport_for` is the Pipecat transport (a packet every 20 ms,
  silence included). `api.run_sip_call` runs it like any phone call; `dial` branches on `byo-phone-number`. Digest login,
  REGISTER (`sipRegisterPlan`), REFER for `transferCall` (`Session.transfer` waits for the NOTIFY with the final answer,
  `REFER_SECONDS`, and a failure comes back to the assistant). Passwords never leave through the API. Never tried with a real carrier.
- `openring/store.py` SQLite document store (JSON docs) for assistants, phone_numbers, calls, tools, campaigns, routes, files,
  knowledge_bases, squads, credentials.
- `openring/static/index.html` single-file dashboard (vanilla JS, no build step), styled after OmniRoute:
  sidebar with sections, dark/light theme, big-number cards, tabs. Pages: Home (overview + get started),
  Assistants (tiles; editor with Setup/JSON tabs), Squads, Knowledge, Phone numbers (with SIP trunks), Model routes, Calls (filters; detail with transcript,
  per-turn latency, JSON), Campaigns (list/CSV, consent checkbox, progress), Providers, Settings (API
  access, password).
- `openring/__main__.py` `openring` command: first run creates `~/.openring/.env` with a generated
  `OPENRING_API_KEY`, DB at `~/.openring/openring.db`, binds 127.0.0.1:8000.
- `bin/openring.js` + `package.json` npm launcher: installs uv if missing, runs
  `uv tool run --python 3.12 --from "openring[kokoro,whisper]==<package.json version>" openring` (the PyPI release
  matching the launcher), opens the browser. `OPENRING_SOURCE` (e.g. `file:///C:/openring` or a git URL)
  runs that source instead. Until the first PyPI release, `npx` needs `OPENRING_SOURCE`.
- Releases (`docs/releasing.md`): tag `vX.Y.Z` -> `.github/workflows/release.yml` checks the tag matches
  `pyproject.toml`, `openring/__init__.py` and `package.json`, tests, publishes to PyPI, then npm. Trusted
  publishing (OIDC), no stored tokens; npm's first version is published by hand (npm needs the package to
  exist before trusting a workflow).
- Built on Pipecat 1.15 (services use `Settings(...)` objects; VAD via
  `LLMUserAggregatorParams(vad_analyzer=SileroVADAnalyzer())`).

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,kokoro,whisper]"   # dev install
pytest                           # incl. a simulated Twilio call and a real local WebRTC call
python -m openring               # run server (reads ./.env and ~/.openring/.env)
npx openring                     # one-command run, once released on npm and PyPI
```

Only one server can use port 8000; stop the old one first, or pass `--port`.

## Phone testing notes

- A Twilio trial account calls only verified numbers, through Twilio's shared "Sandbox Number". That
  sandbox's proxy re-signs webhooks (they fail validation with the account token) and the media stream
  never opens, so callers hear silence. Test with an inbound call to a number you bought, or upgrade.
- The Calls API on trial rejects the `Method`/`StatusCallbackMethod` parameters.
- On a trial, an inbound call to a bought number works: Twilio plays its trial notice, the caller presses a
  key, then the voice webhook runs (confirmed on a real call, 2026-11-01).
- To reach a local server, use a tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000`). Quick-tunnel
  URLs change on every start: update `PUBLIC_URL` and the number's voice webhook.

## Conventions

- `PRINCIPLES.md` holds the project's promises (no platform fee, your keys, Vapi-compatible, one command,
  honest status) and its feature test; check new work against it.
- Keep the Vapi JSON shape for any new field; prefer adding over renaming.
- Every feature gets a test; `pytest` and `ruff check .` must pass before pushing. Tests never use the internet
  (`tests/conftest.py` blocks it); a test that runs a call uses the `quiet_providers` fixture.
- Never commit `.env` or keys. Don't use Vapi's name or logo except to say "Vapi-compatible".
- Third-party licenses are listed in THIRD_PARTY.md; update it when dependencies change.

Maintainers keep private notes (plans, status, working rules) outside git; Claude loads them when present:
